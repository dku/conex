- briscoe-conex-initial-deploy still alive?

- The decision on when and which IP flows move is typically based on
  static configured rules, whereas the use of CONEX mechanisms could
  also factor in real-time congestion information in the decision.

  - how static is this really? (ANDSF?)

- ConEx in general can make users "pay" (or at least suffer) from
  insufficient capacity (because they are expected to back off). In
  wireless networks this can be the case even more so, because cells
  can be unevenly populated, higher distance to base stations can lead
  to higher resource usage and potentially higher marking
  probability. Is this an issue we want to mention?
